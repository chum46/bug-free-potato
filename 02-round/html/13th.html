        <p>Narrative was clear and expertly supported. The people they interviewed gave great perspective and
           context. Bryan Stevenson is someone I really admire and I hang on every word he says. I love how they showed 
           the through-line to the present day version of the cycle of oppression. Showing how cryptically written laws 
           allow for racist enforcement was eye-opening. If ALEC wrote these laws with racist intentions did those who 
           passed them know? Or were they just cashing checks?</p>

          <p>Overall a fair presentation of a really difficult topic. I think the director's political leanings were evident, but not
          in a way that was overly confrontational towards those on the right side aisle. Recognizing this as an American problem
          leaves space for bipartisan solutions.</p>

        <h2>former Nixon domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman </h2>
        <p>“We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the
        hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt their communities.”</p>

        <h2>Michelle Alexander </h2>
        <p>'So many aspects of the old Jim Crow are suddenly legal again once you’ve been branded a felon. And so it seems that in
        America we haven’t so much ended racial caste, but simply redesigned it.'</p>

        <h2>Angela Davis </h2>
        <p>“That's why when someone asks me about violence, I just find it incredible because what it means is that the person
        who's asking that question has absolutely no idea what black people have gone through, what black people have
        experienced in this country since the time the first black person was kidnapped from the shores of Africa.”</p>

        <h2>Lee Atwater </h2>
        <p>'You start out in 1954 by saying, “N*, n*, n*.” By 1968 you can’t say “n*”—that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff
        like, uh, forced busing, states’ rights, and all that stuff, and you’re getting so abstract. Now, you’re talking about
        cutting taxes, and all these things you’re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks
        get hurt worse than whites.… “We want to cut this,” is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of
        a lot more abstract than “N*, n*.”'</p>
